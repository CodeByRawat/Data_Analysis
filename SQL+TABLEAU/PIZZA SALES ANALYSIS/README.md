# Pizza Sales Analysis

Understanding pizza sales trends and customer preferences is critical for optimizing operations and improving business performance. This project leverages **SQL** for data exploration and **Tableau** for interactive visualizations to analyze pizza sales data and uncover actionable insights.

## Project Overview

The **Pizza Sales Analysis** project focuses on extracting insights from pizza sales data by calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizing trends and distributions. The goal is to understand revenue performance, customer behavior, and product popularity, enabling data-driven decision-making.

## Project Scope

This project involves:
1. Calculating key metrics such as total revenue, average order value, and total pizzas sold.
2. Visualizing hourly and weekly sales trends to identify patterns.
3. Analyzing pizza category and size distributions to understand customer preferences.
4. Highlighting best- and worst-performing pizzas to guide business strategy.

## Tools and Technologies

- **SQL**: Used for data exploration and KPI calculation.
- **Tableau**: Used for visualizing insights and creating an interactive dashboard.
- **Database Management System**: SQL Server (or specify the platform used, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- **Excel**: Dataset source file (if applicable).

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The following metrics were calculated to assess business performance:
1. **Total Revenue**: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. **Average Order Value (AOV)**: Total revenue divided by the total number of orders.
3. **Total Pizzas Sold**: The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
4. **Total Orders**: The total count of orders placed.
5. **Average Pizzas Per Order**: Total pizzas sold divided by the total number of orders.

## Visualizations

The Tableau dashboard includes the following visualizations:

1. **Hourly Trend for Total Pizzas Sold**:
   - Displays hourly trends of total orders to identify patterns or fluctuations in order volumes throughout the day.

2. **Weekly Trend for Total Orders**:
   - Illustrates weekly trends in total orders to identify peak weeks or high-order periods.

3. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category**:
   - Shows the distribution of sales across different pizza categories, highlighting their contribution to overall sales.

4. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size**:
   - Displays the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes to understand customer preferences.

5. **Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category**:
   - Compares the total number of pizzas sold across different categories.

6. **Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders**:
   - Highlights the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on revenue, total quantity, and total orders.

7. **Bottom 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders**:
   - Showcases the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas to identify underperforming options.
