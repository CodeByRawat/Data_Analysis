## Mushroom Classification

This project involves classifying mushrooms as either edible or poisonous using a logistic regression model. The dataset contains features related to the mushroom’s physical properties, which help determine the class.
Approach

The dataset was cleaned, and categorical features were encoded using label encoding.Logistic regression was applied to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous.The model was evaluated using accuracy, and cross-validation was performed to ensure robustness.

## Dataset

The dataset contains various attributes describing mushrooms. Each row represents a mushroom with its corresponding features and label (edible or poisonous).
Features:

    Cap shape
    Cap surface
    Cap color
    Bruises
    Odor
    Gill attachment
    Gill spacing
    Gill size
    Stalk shape
    Stalk color
    Veil type
    Ring number
    Spore print color

## Results

The logistic regression model achieved a high accuracy score, indicating the classifier’s effectiveness in distinguishing between edible and poisonous mushrooms.
Conclusion

The project demonstrates how logistic regression can be used to classify data with categorical features. The dataset's well-defined features made it suitable for binary classification tasks.
